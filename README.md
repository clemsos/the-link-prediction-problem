# The Link Prediction Problem

Resources and scripts to experiment with link prediction in a network 

> Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions among its members are likely to occur in the near future? We formalize this question as the link-prediction problem, and we develop approaches to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the “proximity” of nodes in a network.
